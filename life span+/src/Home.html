        <p class = "para">The Diet and Health checkup system is an end user support and an online resource tool system. Here we propose a system that allows users to receive instant guidance
            on health & wellness through an online platform. When you go to a nutrition specialist, he or she will ask you your details related to body and health such as your 
           age, your height, your weight and how much water do your consumer in a day and how much work do you do regularly. Just like this nutrition specialist, the system
            also asks you similar questions in your platform, and you have to answer all those questions. These include questions such as age, gender, weight, and height. This
            system will also advise you about what should your intake in your diet and what should you ignore to keep yourself healthy via your diet. The scope of the system
            will be limited to the following aspects: 
           • BMI calculator for students who are enrolled in the system.
            • Sleep Insights include tips, benefits, and FAQ. 
           • Stress Survey: “How do you know you’re stressed” survey. 
           
           In this system, using the technique of artificial intelligence, you will get access to all resources via this web application, which is provided by the system. The main 
           advantage of using this web application is a healthier lifestyle that provides awareness. Also, this system offers more than one diet plan also, for customized preferences.
